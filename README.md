### Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)

**Title:** Fireball over Cape San Blas
**Date:** 2025-07-23

Have you ever seen a fireball?  In astronomy, a fireball is a very bright meteor -- one at least as bright as Venus and possibly brighter than even a full Moon. Fireballs are rare -- if you see one you are likely to remember it for your whole life.  Physically, a fireball is a small rock that originated from an asteroid or comet that typically leaves a fading smoke trail of gas and dust as it shoots through the Earth's atmosphere.  It is unlikely that any single large ground strike occurred -- much of the rock likely vaporized as it broke up into many small pieces. The featured picture was captured last week from a deadwood beach in Cape San Blas, Florida, USA.   Piece it Back Together: Astronomy Puzzle of the Day
